Shramik – Empowering India's Skilled Workforce
🪓 TL;DR

Shramik is India's first digital platform focused on connecting skilled informal workers (carpenters, plumbers, electricians, drivers, etc.) with local job opportunities in real time.

We are building the UrbanClap / Upwork / LinkedIn for Bharat’s blue-collar workforce — but with deep local trust, low-tech onboarding, and high-impact outcomes.
💡 Problem We’re Solving
India’s Informal Workforce is Massive but Disconnected:

    400M+ informal workers make up over 90% of India’s labor force.

    They face inconsistent work, no digital presence, and no trusted platforms.

    Employers (contractors, homeowners, businesses) struggle to find verified, skilled, local workers.

    🤝 There’s no single platform that brings together workers, employers, trust signals, and local availability — until now.

🧑‍🔧 Skilled Workers to:
